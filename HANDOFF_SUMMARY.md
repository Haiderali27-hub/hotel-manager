# 🚀 Project Handoff Summary

## What You Need to Do Before Giving to Your Teammate

### 1. ✅ Test the Backend (5 minutes)
```bash
# Start the app
npm run tauri dev
```
- Open the app and verify it loads
- Open browser dev tools (F12) 
- Use the commands in `BACKEND_TEST.md` to test APIs
- Confirm you see "Database initialized successfully" in console

### 2. 📚 Package the Documentation
Your teammate will need these files:
- ✅ `FEATURES_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete feature list and priorities
- ✅ `FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md` - Technical setup and development guide  
- ✅ `FRONTEND_DEPENDENCIES.md` - Recommended packages to install
- ✅ `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API reference
- ✅ `BACKEND_TEST.md` - How to test backend functionality
- ✅ `ExampleUsage.tsx` - Working code examples

### 3. 🗂️ Organize Project Files
```
