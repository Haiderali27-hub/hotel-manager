# ✅ ALL TWEAKS IMPLEMENTED - PRODUCTION READY

## 🎯 **COMPREHENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED**

### ✅ **1. Database Constraints Enhanced**
**✓ Foreign Keys Enabled:**
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` - Applied in both main db.rs and database_reset.rs
- Proper ON DELETE constraints: RESTRICT, SET NULL, CASCADE as appropriate

**✓ Foreign Key Declarations:**
- ✅ `guests.room_id` → `rooms(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT
- ✅ `food_orders.guest_id` → `guests(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL  
- ✅ `food_order_items.order_id` → `food_orders(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
- ✅ `food_order_items.menu_item_id` → `menu_items(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT
- ✅ `rooms.guest_id` → `guests(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL

### ✅ **2. Timestamp Columns Added**
**✓ Created_at/Updated_at Defaults:**
- ✅ `rooms` - created_at, updated_at (with triggers)
- ✅ `guests` - created_at, updated_at (with triggers)  
- ✅ `menu_items` - created_at, updated_at (with triggers)
- ✅ `food_orders` - created_at (existing)
- ✅ `expenses` - created_at
- ✅ `admin_settings` - created_at, updated_at (with triggers)

**✓ Automatic Update Triggers:**
- Triggers automatically set `updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` on any UPDATE
- Applied to: rooms, guests, menu_items, admin_settings

### ✅ **3. Paid Timestamps Enhanced**
**✓ Food Orders paid_at Column:**
- ✅ `food_orders.paid_at` - DATETIME column for tracking payment time
- ✅ Enhanced seed data with realistic paid_at timestamps
- ✅ Index created: `idx_food_orders_paid_at` for performance
- ✅ Monthly income grouping now possible: `GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', paid_at)`
